# jExifToolGUI
**Graphical frontend for the excellent command-line ExifTool by Phil Harvey.**

**DEVELOPMENT HAS STOPPED**<br>
**After many years, I decided to stop the development. I lost all interest in "special" photography like animal, bird and panorama photography. I sold all my equipment and got myself an expensive smartphone with good main lens, ultrawide and 3x tele which fits my needs on hikes/walks, travels and holidays, but doesn't require any progam other than Google Photos (for example).**<br>
I know there are bugs in the program and I know there are still things that can be improved. And there are users asking for more functionality.
So again: apologies for leaving it in this state where some users stumble on serious bugs or not completed functionality, but at the same time in a state where most users can easily and comfortably use it.

If someone wants to take over, please let me know and I give full access to the repository. It is 100% open source anyway. Or you simply fork it and continue it in your own way.<br><br><br>

**jExifToolGUI** is a java/Swing program for Windows/Linux/macOS that functions as a graphical frontend (GUI) for [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/).<br><br>
jExifToolGUI is (just) a graphical frontend for ExifTool. It can use a "reference" image to write the tags to a multiple set of photos, like GPS tags for photos taken at the same location but somehow miss or contain incorrect GPS info.<br>
jExifToolGUI also contains extensive renaming functionality based on the Exif info in your photos.<br>

**ExifTool** is a platform-independent Perl command-line application and library for reading, writing and editing metadata in a wide variety of files.<br>
Many thanks go to Phil Harvey for his excellent tool. Without ExifTool, this graphical frontend for ExifTool would never have existed.<br>
[Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) is by far the best and most extensive metadata tool available!<br>
It reads and writes metadata information from/to many files, but primarily focuses on photos/images. It reads/writes EXIF, GPS, XMP, maker notes for many cameras, JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix, VRA Core 4, ISAD(G) and many, many more tags.<br>
It can use a "reference" image to write the tags to a multiple set of photos or a complete directory containing photos.<br>
