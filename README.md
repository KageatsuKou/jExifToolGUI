**Graphical frontend for the excellent command-line ExifTool by Phil Harvey.**

**jExifToolGUI** is a java/Swing program for Windows/Linux/macOS that functions as a graphical frontend (GUI) for [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/).<br><br>
jExifToolGUI is (just) a graphical frontend for ExifTool. It can use a "reference" image to write the tags to a multiple set of photos, like GPS tags for photos taken at the same location but somehow miss or contain incorrect GPS info.<br>
jExifToolGUI also contains extensive renaming functionality based on the Exif info in your photos.<br>

**ExifTool** is a platform-independent Perl command-line application and library for reading, writing and editing metadata in a wide variety of files.<br>
Many thanks go to Phil Harvey for his excellent tool. Without ExifTool, this graphical frontend for ExifTool would never have existed.<br>
[Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) is by far the best and most extensive metadata tool available!<br>
It reads and writes metadata information from/to many files, but primarily focuses on photos/images. It reads/writes EXIF, GPS, XMP, maker notes for many cameras, JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix, ISAD(G) and many, many more tags.<br>
It can use a "reference" image to write the tags to a multiple set of photos or a complete directory containing photos.<br>
