exifhelptitle = Help for the Exif edit panel
xmphelptitle = Help for the XMP edit panel
exifandxmphelp = <big>Exif or XMP metadata</big><hr><br>This tab is used to add (a limited amount of) Exif or xmp data (depending on the tab) to your selected image(s).</p>\
<p><b>Things to take into account!</b></p><p>As you can see the options all have a "Save checkbox" behind their input fields. \
It means that this option/field will be saved when checked, even when the field is empty. This also means that you can:\
<ul><li>overwrite existing data with empty data "by accident".</li><li>deliberately clear (overwrite) existing data with an empty string from an empty field.</li></ul>\
<h3>Available buttons:</h3>\
<ul><li><b>Copy from selected image</b>: This will copy all the (available) xmp data from the selected image into the input fields.</li>\
<li><b>Save to selected image(s)</b>: This will save the "checked" Exif data to your selected image(s).</li>\
<li><b>Copy Defaults</b>: This will copy the default creator and rights data which you provided in the Preferences tab.</li>\
<li><b> Reset fields</b>: This will empty all fields and set checkboxes to their defaults.</li>\
<li><b>Help</b>: This button opens this popup that you are currently reading.</li></ul>


geotagginghelptitle = Help for the Geotagging edit panel
geotagginghelp = <big>Geotagging</big><hr><br>Geotagging adds GPS data to your images based on data from a GPS track log file.\
This GPS track file can be used from your phone, gps device, navigation device, or whatever you have providing such a GPS track.<br>\
 The GPS track log file is loaded, and linear interpolation is used to determine the GPS position at the time of the image, then the relevant tags \
are written to the image (if the corresponding information is available). It means that your camera needs to be set correctly with regard to the date/time of the location where you are.<br><br>\
jExifToolGUI also supports the "Geosync" feature of ExifTool. The Geosync tag is only needed when the image timestamps are not properly synchronized with GPS time.<br>\
For example, a value of "+1:20" specifies that 1 minute and 20 seconds is added to the Geotime value before checking with the GPS track file. This is for a camera running 1 minute 20 seconds slower than the GPS clock.<br>\
The Geosync time is specified as  "SS", "MM:SS", "HH:MM:SS" or "DD HH:MM:SS" (where SS=seconds, MM=minutes, HH=hours and DD=days), \
and a leading "+" or "-" may be added for positive or negative differences.<br><b>Note:</b> Do not use (double) quotes around the geosync time in jExifToolGUI. Simply use something like -25 or +1:20<br><br>\
In jExifToolGUI you have 2 options:\
<ol><li>Use (a selection of) the images you loaded in the left images pane.</li><li>Specify a folder containing a set of images to be tagged.</li></ol></p>\
<p>In case of the first option you need to leave the folder empty. If the "Folder containing the images:" is not left empty, it will always be the first option used.<br><br>\
The "Overwrite Originals" checkbox (default selected) makes that exiftool does an "in place" modification. When unselected new images will be created and the orignals get the extension ".original"<br><br>\
Note that jExifToolGUI will write both the Exif GPS tags as well as the XMP GPS tags.


gpshelptitle = Help for the GPS-Location edit panel
gpshelp = <big>GPS and Location</big><hr><br>This tab is used to add GPS data to your images. This tab works on a combination of Exif, xmp and \
iptc gps data as latitude, longitude and altitude are covered in both the Exif and in the xmp metadata structure.<br><br>\
The Location metadata details (Country, Province/State, City, Location) are covered by xmp and IPTC.<br><br>This tab therefore acts on multiple tag \
categories (Exif, xmp and iptc) at once and simply tries to make your gps/location data as complete as possible in the several tag categories.


yourcommandstitle = Help for the Your Commands panel
yourcommands = <big>Your commands</big><hr><br>On this tab you can define your own parameters to "send to" ExifTool. The parameters will be executed on the images you have selected on the left.\
<br>You can both specify read parameters as well as write parameters but not in one command: write actions take precedence. You can also combine several parameters. \
<b>Note:</b> You don't need (must not) provide the ExifTool command itself. The Gui will take care of that.<br>\
One thing YOU need to take care of is the use of either single quotes or double quotes around some commands. \
If you want to set the file date to the date the photo was taken, you need the command <tt>-FileModifyDate&lt;DateTimeOriginal</tt>.\
On Windows you need to double-quote this and on Linux and MacOS you need to single-quote this, like\
<ul><li>Linux/MacOS: <tt>'-FileModifyDate&lt;DateTimeOriginal'</tt></li><li>Windows: <tt>"-FileModifyDate&lt;DateTimeOriginal"</tt></li></ul>\
Other examples are:<table border="1" cellpadding="10">\
<tr><td>-exif:all</td><td>will display all Exif tags for the selected image(s)</td></tr>\
<tr><td>-exif:all=</td><td>will remove(<b>!</b>) all Exif tags from the selected image(s)</td></tr>\
<tr><td>-Exif:Artist="My Name"</td><td>Will put "Your Name" into the selected image(s)</td></tr>\
<tr><td>-Xmp:City=Zwolle -Xmp:Country=Netherlands</td><td>Will write your city and country into the xmp tags of your image(s)</td></tr></table>\
See also the <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/exiftool_pod.html" target="_blank">exiftool Application Documentation</a> which gives extensive information and lots of examples.


copymetadatatitle = Help for the Copy metadata panel
copymetadatatext = <big>Copy metadata</big><hr><br>This function will copy all or selected metadata from the source image into the target image(s).<br><br>\
This can be done in several ways:<ul>\
<li>all information to same-named tags in the preferred groups</li>\
<li>all info from all tag groups to same tag groups</li>\
<li>selected group to same group</li></ul><br>\
This is NOT an internal "same image to same image" copy to the xmp tag group; See menu "Extra -> Copy all metadata to xmp format" for that option.<br><br>


gpanohelptitle = Help for the Edit Gpano metadata panel
gpanohelp = <big>Gpano</big><hr><br>This tab is used to add GPano Google PhotoSphere data to your selected image(s).<br><br>\
The Google PhotoSphere functionality has been added in November 2012 to enable the use of auto-rotating panoramic photos inside Google products.\
 For more info see the Google page: https://developers.google.com/streetview/spherical-metadata<br><br>\
The fields marked with an asterisk are mandatory. The "Use panorama viewer" is also mandatory, but prefilled. It is here to show you that "it is not forgotten".


renamingtitle = Renaming info
renamingtext = <big>Renaming</big><hr><br>The general date time options will not be mentioned as they are self explanatory.<br><br>\
<b>String:</b> This can be any string you like also with spaces. UTF-8 is used but I can' t predict which "strange" characters might cause an error, maybe also OS dependent.<br><br>\
<b>Camera model:</b> This will extract the camera model from the Exif data of your image(s).<br><br>\
<b>Location:</b> This will extract the "xmp:location" info from your image(s). NOTE: This will only work if your images contain this info. For example because you added that before(!) \
in the "Edit Data -> gps" tab.<br><br>\
<b>City Name:</b> This will extract the "xmp:city" info from your image(s). NOTE: This will only work if your images contain this info. For example because you added that before(!) \
in the "Edit Data -> gps" tab.<br><br>\
<b>ISO value:</b> This will take the "exif:iso" value from images. As ISO is just a numeric value like 100, the string ISO will be added, making it 100ISO.<br><br>\
<b>Focal length in 35 mm:</b> For all of us (not) having a full-frame camera, this will add the corresponding focal length for a 35 mm.<br><br>\
<b>Original file name:</b> This is the original name as given by your camera to your image.<br>


lenshelptitle = Help for the Edit lens data panel
lenshelptext = <big>Edit lens</big><hr><br>This screen has two purposes:<br>\
<ul><li>Add/remove lens data to your photos (first row of buttons)</li>\
<li>Create/Modify a lens configuration (second row of buttons enclosed inside lined framework).</li></ul>\
Both options can be used to add lens data to your image if it is not complete.<br><br>\
Next to that: Still some add-on lenses are not completely recognized by the camera and therefore the info is not added to the image. For these cases you can create lens configs \
and save and load them for your images taken with that specific lens.


exiftooldbtitle = Help for the ExifTool database query panel
exiftooldbhelptext = <big>ExifTool database Query screen</big><hr><br>\
exiftool comes with a huge set of tags for the several families (g0, g1, g2, g3, g4) and groups (like Exif, XMP, IPTC, etc.). All these tags can also be listed from ExifTool itself \
but it's less easy to see which tag(s) belong to which group(s). Also in plural: some tags come back multiple times in makernotes for camera's, or specific camera data. \
And some are almost equal to each other.<br><br>\
And why a database?: It's fast! And it can also be used to store "custom settings" like lenses (lens configurations) and personal views (ToDo).<br><br>\
(Note: The ExifTool version to build the included database version is not necessarily the same as your installed ExifTool version.)<br><br>\
This screen comes in 3 "action rows":<br>\
<ol><li>1st line: two comboboxes (dropdowns) that you can select to query the tags (do not forget to select the radio button in front of it. \
(This was first automatic but then the query becomes really "nervous" as it will act on every change.)<br>\
The second is actually a subset of the first (current 320) options but experience from my previous pyExifToolGUI program learns that most users are interested in their own camera.</li>\
<li>2nd line: This is a "wildcard" query. Search for example on "width" and it will find all tagnames with "width" in the name (and there are a lot).</li>\
<li>3rd line: Here you can put your own query like "select taggroup,tagname from Groups,Tags,tagsingroups where tagsingroups.groupid=Groups.id and tagsingroups.tagid=tags.id and Groups.taggroup='EXIF';".<br>\
A database diagram is available for those (expert) users wanting to use this option.


abouttitle = About jExifToolGUI for ExifTool by Phil Harvey
abouttext = <big>jExifToolGUI</big><hr><br>\
<strong>jExifToolGui</strong> is a java/Swing program that functions as \
a graphical frontend (GUI) for <a href='http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/'>ExifTool</a>.<br><br>\
Exiftool is written and maintained by Phil Harvey. Many thanks go to him for this excellent tool. Without ExifTool, \
this Graphical frontend for ExifTool would never have existed.<br><br>\
jExifToolGUI is (just) a graphical frontend for ExifTool. \
It can use a "reference" image to write the tags to a multiple set of photos, like gps tags for photos\
 that were taken at the same location but somehow miss or contain the incorrect gps info.<br>\
jExifToolGUI also contains extensive renaming functionality based on the Exif info in your photos.\

aboutexiftooltitle = About ExifTool by Phil Harvey
aboutexiftool = <big>ExifTool</big><hr><br>\
ExifTool is a platform-independent Perl command-line application and library for reading, writing and editing meta information in a wide variety of files.<br> \
ExifTool is by far the best and most extensive metadata tool available!<br><br>\
It reads and writes metadata information from/to many files, but primarily focuses on photos/images. It reads/writes Exif, GPS, XMP, maker notes for \
many cameras, JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix and many, many more tags.<br>\
It can use a "reference" image to write the tags to a multiple set of photos or a complete directory containing photos.<br>\
